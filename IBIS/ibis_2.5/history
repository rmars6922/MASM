    variables

    added verification of weather generator
12) weather.f, daily, line 10
    added nanom, iyrlast, nrun to passed variables
13) weather.f, daily, lines 135-142
    added nanom, iyrlast, nrun, precipfac, dif
14) weather.f, daily, line 244, 254-502
    changed pwet statement
    and added block to figure out daily precip for month

    added block to check hourly precip

NCEP anomaly changes:
1)  combcs.h, lines 41-55
    added real declarations to new daily anomaly variables and
    put them in a new common block, /combcs5/
2)  io.f, rdday, lines 5326-5418
    changed filenames, ERROR statements, iyear statement, and arr2vec
    for all new daily anomaly data variables: prec, temp, trange, cld, 
    wspd, and sphum
3)  io-hdf.f, lines 4277-4357 
    same as 2)
4)  io-mac-hdf.f, lines 4442-4522
    same as 2)

    added real declaration for new local variables
8)  weather.f, daily, lines 831-882
    Added new calculations for all weather variables.
    This new algorithm allows NCEP daily data
    to be used along with monthly CRU data to calculate better daily data
    than the CRU monthly data alone. The NCEP data that is read in io.f
    is not true data but anomalies of the NCEP data (fractional or additive).
    These statements add or multiply the CRU data by these anomalies. For
    example, if a particular day's NCEP precipitation is 0.5 mm/day and the 
    NCEP total month's precipitation is 4.0 mm/day, the day's anomaly is
    0.125. In the model, the CRU monthly preciptitation is multiplied by 
    0.125 so that this day's precipitation is 0.125 the monthly value.
9)  weather.f, daily, lines 862-863
    note that the calculation for psurf has been moved up since it is
    needed earlier in the code than before.

Additional change:
1)  initial.f, iniveg, line 1572
    corrected rhoveg of lower story, nir leaf reflectance to be equal to value
    given in Sellers et al., 1996 (was 0.60, now 0.58--minor)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
IBIS 2.5b3 ---> IBIS 2.5b4
--------------------------
01/11/2001
J. Lenters
General changes:
1) New routine for evaporation from bare soil. Uses the "beta" method (see
   documentation in code), converted to the "alpha" method for use in IBIS.
   Tunable parameters in canopy.f include zwopt (currently set to 1.0) and
   zwdry (currently set to the wilting point). These are the assumed values
   of surface moisture (soil+puddle) at which soil evaporation is maximum
   and minimum (~zero), respectively. The new evaporation routine also
   includes a correction factor to account for the proper "temperature of
   the evaporating surface" (based on Milly 1992). Finally, the partitioning
   of soil evaporation between puddle and soil has been modified so that it
   is proportional to the (assumed) fraction of surface area covered by
   soil/puddle and liquid/ice. The parameter "zwpmax" in soil.f is currently
   set to 0.5, but can be considered tunable. It is the assumed fraction of
   soil surface area covered by puddle when wpud+wipud>=wpudmax.
2) The lowest sigma level in IBIS has been changed from 0.995 to 0.999 to
   more closely approximate the 10-m level.
3) The "dsat" function in comsat.h has been changed to "dqsat" and is now
   the exact derivation of d(qsat)/dT (no approximations, as in 2.5b3).
4) New code from Christine Molling has been added to set the rain temperature
   equal to the wet bulb temperature (instead of air temperature, as before).
5) Monthly mean air temperature has been added as an output variable. This
   is because the input and output can be different when the wxgen is used.
6) Total soil depth has been changed from 12m to 4m.
7) Modified the reading of monthly anomaly files so that if the end of an
   anomaly file is reached, IBIS loops back to the beginning of the file.
   This is for doing long runs by repeatedly using detrended anomaly files.
8) Minor changes to variable names and comments.

Soil evaporation:
1) canopy.f
   - lines 523-526, 604(old): modified list of declared variables

2) soil.f
   - lines 35-41: modified list of declared variables
   - lines 88-156: changed calculation of fraction of soil evap
   - lines 306-308: changed comment to warn of negative puddle depths

   - lines 87-97: changed dsat to desat (derivative of esat, not qsat)
   - lines 106-110: added function dqsat (like old dsat, but no approx)

Rain temperature:
1) canopy.f
   - lines 1721-1723: added variable/function declarations
   - lines 1753-1761: sets rain temperature to wet bulb temperature
   - lines 2328-2397: added function twet3 to calculate wet bulb temp

Monthly output of air temperature:
1) initial.f
   - line 309: added initialization of variable "amtemp"
2) io.f (similarly for io-hdf.f, io-hdf-mac.f)
   - lines 2196-2219: added code to write out "amtemp" every month
3) stats.f
   - line 707: calculates monthly mean air temperature (amtemp)
4) comsum.h
   - line 47: added declaration of amtemp
   - lines 80-81: added amtemp to common statement

Soil depth:
1) initial.f
   - lines 610-611(old): removed bottom 2 soil layers so that total = 4m
   - line 664: changed comment
2) io.f (similarly for io-hdf.f, io-hdf-mac.f)
   - lines 5509, 5551-5556, 5648, 5762-5783: removed extra diagnostic
     variables associated with previously deeper soil layers
3) main.f
   - lines 27-28: same as for io.f
4) compar.h
   - line 72: changed nsoilay from 8 to 6

Monthly anomaly looping; minor comment/variable changes:
1) io.f (similarly for io-hdf.f, io-hdf-mac.f)
   - lines 4997, 5026-5031, 5042, 5059: changed old "nanom" to "iyranom,"
     removed "istop," and added new "nanom" (# of years in anomaly files),
     "iy2" (last year of run), "jyear" (looping index).
   - line 5008: change in spacing
   - line 5056-5062: corrected mistake where anomalies were not being read
     in correctly at beginning of run.
   - lines 5063-5085: added contingency that if it's the last month of the
     run and of the anomaly files, then climatologies are used for January
     (rather than simply stopping the run when no anomalies are available)
   - line 5084(old): removed "istop" (for reasons above)
   - lines 5094-5100, 5104: changed indexing so IBIS loops back to beginning
     when end of anomaly file is reached (set by nanom in ibis.infile)
   - lines 5081-5085(old): replaced "istop" with regular stop condition
2) main.f
   - lines 45-46, 59, 118, 120, 187, 263, 268: changed old "nanom" to
     "iyranom," removed "istop," changed "ndanomy" to "iyrdaily," and added
     new "nanom" (# of years in anomaly files).
   - lines 276-280, 365: removed istop and added variables in call to rdanom
   - lines 384, 386, 388, 540: changed variable names ("ndanomy" ->
     "iyrdaily", "nanom" -> "iyranom")
   - lines 579-585(old): removed istop condition since looping is allowed
3) weather.f
   - lines 10, 64-65, 137, 191, 228, 442, 499, 587, 726: changed variable

4) ibis.infile
   - lines 4-6: changed "nanom" to "iyranom" and "ndanomy" to "iyrdaily".
     Also added line 5 to set value for new "nanom" (total number of years
     in the anomaly files; if the anomaly files differ in length, choose
     the smallest)
